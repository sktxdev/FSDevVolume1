# WebAppsMadeEasy

This is a set of sample applications covering various scenarios that can be extended or borrowed from for your own application. The code is entirely free and located at github/sktxdev/


### Applications
- Patient Management System (Humans)	https://github.com/sktxdev/pms
- Vet Portal				https://github.com/sktxdev/vets
- Lost Pet Finder			https://github.com/sktxdev/pets
- Student Enrollment Portal		https://github.com/sktxdev/students
- Generic CRM				https://github.com/sktxdev/crm

### Technologies
- Front End: Angular 9, Typescript, scss, html etc
- Middle tier(api): Dotnet Core, C#, DB Code is linq and dapper
- Databse: SQL Server (some use of stored procedures)

### Rationale:
I'm using Microsoft technologies because thats what I used on a day to day basic. I may convert this to use other databases, but the UI and API are generic enough that they can be pointed at a different database with little trouble.
